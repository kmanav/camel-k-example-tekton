# Camel K Pipeline Example
 
![Camel K CI](https://github.com/openshift-integration/camel-k-example-basic/workflows/Camel%20K%20CI/badge.svg)

This example creates an pipeline that deploys Camel K applications.

Tekton is a powerful yet flexible Kubernetes-native open-source framework for creating continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD) systems. It lets you build, test, and deploy across multiple cloud providers or on-premises systems by abstracting away the underlying implementation details.

Camel K can be directly used in Tekton Pipelines tasks since itâ€™s container image ships the kamel CLI tool, that can be used to create all needed resources by interacting with the Kubernetes cluster.

## Before you begin

Make sure you check-out this repository from git and open it with [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

Instructions are based on [VSCode Didact](https://github.com/redhat-developer/vscode-didact), so make sure it's installed
from the VSCode extensions marketplace.

From the VSCode UI, click on the `readme.didact.md` file and select "Didact: Start Didact tutorial from File". A new Didact tab will be opened in VS Code.

[Make sure you've checked all the requirements](./requirements.didact.md) before jumping into the tutorial section.

## Checking requirements

<a href='didact://?commandId=vscode.didact.validateAllRequirements' title='Validate all requirements!'><button>Validate all Requirements at Once!</button></a>


**OpenShift CLI ("oc")**

The OpenShift CLI tool ("oc") will be used to interact with the OpenShift cluster.

[Check if the OpenShift CLI ("oc") is installed](didact://?commandId=vscode.didact.cliCommandSuccessful&text=oc-requirements-status$$oc%20help "Tests to see if `oc help` returns a 0 return code"){.didact}

*Status: unknown*{#oc-requirements-status}

**Tekton CLI ("tkn")**

The Tekton CLI tool ("tkn") will be used to interact with Tekton.

[Check if the Tekton CLI ("tkn") is installed](didact://?commandId=vscode.didact.cliCommandSuccessful&text=tkn-requirements-status$$tkn%20help "Tests to see if `tkn help` returns a 0 return code"){.didact}

*Status: unknown*{#tkn-requirements-status}

**Apache Camel K CLI ("kamel")**

Apart from the support provided by the VS Code extension, you also need the Apache Camel K CLI ("kamel") in order to 
access all Camel K features.

[Check if the Apache Camel K CLI ("kamel") is installed](didact://?commandId=vscode.didact.requirementCheck&text=kamel-requirements-status$$kamel%20version$$Camel%20K%20Client&completion=Apache%20Camel%20K%20CLI%20is%20available%20on%20this%20system. "Tests to see if `kamel version` returns a result"){.didact}

*Status: unknown*{#kamel-requirements-status}


**Connection to an OpenShift cluster**

You need to connect to an OpenShift cluster in order to run the examples.

[Check if you're connected to an OpenShift cluster](didact://?commandId=vscode.didact.requirementCheck&text=cluster-requirements-status$$oc%20get%20project$$NAME&completion=OpenShift%20is%20connected. "Tests to see if `kamel version` returns a result"){.didact}

*Status: unknown*{#cluster-requirements-status}




## 1. Preparing a new OpenShift project

Go to your working project `userX-new` where you'll run the Pipeline.

To create the project, open a terminal tab and type the following command:


```
oc project userX-new
```
([^ execute](didact://?commandId=vscode.didact.sendNamedTerminalAString&text=camelTerm$$oc%20project%20userX-new&completion=New%20project%20creation. "Opens a new terminal and sends the command above"){.didact})


**OpenShift Pipelines Operator** should have installed. 

Note: 
**Setting up a Service Account**
There are some premission that needs to pre-set before started as cluster admin, this is already pre-installed for you.

```
oc apply -f camel-k-pipeline-permissions.yaml
```


## 2. Creating the Pipeline Definition

This creates a series of resources, including a pipeline definition that you can immediately see on the OpenShift developer console.

```
oc apply -f camel-k-pipeline-task-definition.yaml
```
([^ execute](didact://?commandId=vscode.didact.sendNamedTerminalAString&text=camelTerm$$oc%20apply%20-f%20camel-k-pipeline-task-definition.yaml&completion=pipeline%20configured. "Opens a new terminal and sends the command above"){.didact})

The pipeline just created is composed of three tasks.

First task just installs the operator in the namespace, second task, starts an Camel K application and the last task starts an Camel K in Quarkus runtime.

The tasks are executed in sequence in the pipeline from installing the operator and runs both Camel K applications.

You can list all the avaliable tasks with the following command.

```
tkn task list
```
([^ execute](didact://?commandId=vscode.didact.sendNamedTerminalAString&text=camelTerm$$tkn%20task%20list. "Opens a new terminal and sends the command above"){.didact})

You shoule see three tasks listed:

    - camel-k-install-operator   
    - camel-k-run-integration    
    - camel-k-run-quarkus        


## 3. Triggering a Pipeline execution

Everything is now ready to be executed and the last thing missing is a trigger. First you can list all pipelines.

```
tkn pipeline list
```
([^ execute](didact://?commandId=vscode.didact.sendNamedTerminalAString&text=camelTerm$$tkn%20pipeline%20list. "Opens a new terminal and sends the command above"){.didact})

You will see a pipeline listed below

    - camel-k-pipeline

Starts the execution of the pipeline and its progress can be monitored on the OpenShift console.

```
tkn pipeline start camel-k-pipeline
```
([^ execute](didact://?commandId=vscode.didact.sendNamedTerminalAString&text=camelTerm$$tkn%20pipeline%20start%20camel-k-pipeline. "Opens a new terminal and sends the command above"){.didact})

The result of the pipeline execution is integration named hello and basic running on the cluster.


Congrats! You have complete this example. To re-run, make sure you reset the namespace.

```
kamel reset

oc delete integrationplatform camel-k
```
